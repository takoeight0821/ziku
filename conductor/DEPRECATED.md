# DEPRECATED

The `conductor` framework and this directory are now deprecated in favor of the **GitHub-First Context-Driven Development (CDD)** workflow.

## Why?
- **Source of Truth**: Planning should live where the code and collaboration live (GitHub), not in side-car markdown files.
- **Visibility**: Progress is now tracked via GitHub Issues and Pull Requests.
- **Automation**: Better integration with `gh` CLI and AI agent tools.

## What to do?
- **New Tasks**: Please use `./scripts/task-init.sh "description"` to start new work.
- **Existing Tracks**: Finish them here or migrate them to GitHub Issues.
- **Documentation**: See [docs/cdd-workflow.md](../docs/cdd-workflow.md) for the new process.
