# Product Guide

## Initial Concept
Ziku is an experimental project implementing a functional programming language that explores the duality between data and codata. It features a sequent calculus IR, copattern matching, and type inference. This project also focuses on AI-driven development.

## Vision
To create a functional programming language implemented in Lean 4 that explicitly models data/codata symmetry, serving as a platform for exploring sequent calculus based compilation and pioneering AI-driven development workflows in language design.

## Core Features
- **Data & Codata Symmetry:** Explicit support for pattern matching (data) and copattern matching (codata).
- **Sequent Calculus IR:** A λμμ̃-calculus based intermediate representation that makes symmetry explicit.
- **Type System:** Hindley-Milner type inference based on row-polymorphism.
- **AI-Driven Development:** Proactive use of AI agents for feature implementation, refactoring, and codebase evolution.
- **Control Flow:** First-class control structures using `label` and `goto`.

## Target Audience
- Programming Language Researchers
- AI-Assisted Developers
- Functional Programming Enthusiasts interested in type theory and compiler design.
