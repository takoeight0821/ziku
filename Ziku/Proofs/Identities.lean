# Algebraic Identities

This module contains proofs about algebraic identities.
These proofs need to be updated for the new IR structure.

-- Placeholder: Full identity proofs need to handle the new IR
-- Identities like e + 0 = e, e * 1 = e, etc. can be proven once
-- the evaluation structure is finalized.
