# Evaluation Correctness Proofs

This module contains proofs about the IR evaluation semantics.
Note: Since `eval` is marked as `partial`, some proofs need native_decide
or other tactics rather than rfl.

-- Variable evaluation depends on environment
-- These are the main provable properties without native evaluation
