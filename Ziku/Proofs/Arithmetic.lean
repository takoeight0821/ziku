# Arithmetic Properties

This module contains proofs about arithmetic operations.
These proofs need to be updated for the new AST structure.

-- Placeholder: Full arithmetic proofs need to handle the new Value type
-- Addition commutativity, associativity, etc. can be proven once
-- the evaluation structure is finalized.
