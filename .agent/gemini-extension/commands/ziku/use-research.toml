The skill file contains:
- Phase 1: Discovery - Find relevant research documents
- Phase 2: Analysis - Deep-read and extract patterns
- Phase 3: Application - Apply research to current task
- Example usage for common scenarios

Research documents are located in `docs/research/` and cover:
- Type inference (HM, Algorithm W/J/M)
- Sequent calculus (λμμ̃-calculus, IR design)
- Testing strategies (golden tests)
- Related implementations
